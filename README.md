## 🧩 The Problem

Managing events at an institute is broken. Organisers juggle Google Forms, WhatsApp groups, and spreadsheets. Participants miss deadlines buried in chat threads. Teams get formed over DMs, eligibility is checked by hand, and attendance is tracked on paper.

**Circles fixes all of that — in one place.**

| 🏗️ For Organisers & Admins | 🎓 For Participants |
|:--- |:--- |
| **Fragmented Control**: Every event lives in its own form and group. | **Discovery Issues**: Events found through posters/spam, not a feed. |
| **Manual Verification**: Team eligibility is checked by hand. | **Registration Chaos**: No single "My Events" view. |
| **Outdated Tracking**: Manual attendance and reporting. | **Missing Updates**: Reschedules get buried in chat threads. |

---

## ✨ Core Features (MVP)

### 🗓️ Event Engine
Create and manage events end-to-end — schedules, venues, capacity, tags, and registration windows, all in one form. Participants can filter and discover events by domain (Web, AI, Blockchain, etc.).

### 👥 Team System
Generate unique invite codes, enforce team size rules, and handle join requests cleanly — no more losing codes over chat. Validation is fully automatic.

### 🔔 Smart Notifications
Email confirmations on registration plus an in-app notification centre for announcements, reminders, and team updates. Admins get alerts on new registrations in real time.

### 📊 Admin Dashboard
A real-time console for organisers — registration counts, attendance toggles, participant data, custom field responses, and QR-based check-in, all from one screen.

### 🎫 QR Check-in
Participants carry a QR code. Organisers scan it. The live dashboard count updates instantly. No clipboards, no spreadsheets.

### 🛡️ Role-based Access
JWT authentication with separate flows for `ADMIN` and `PARTICIPANT` roles. Organisers get creation and management rights; participants get discovery and registration.

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment on **Vercel**.

1. **Connect your GitHub repo** to Vercel.
2. **Environment Variables**: Add `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL) and `JWT_SECRET` in the Vercel Dashboard.
3. **Build Settings**: Vercel will automatically use the settings in `vercel.json` and `package.json`.
4. **Prisma**: The `postinstall` script handles Prisma client generation automatically.
